//Task:
//In this challenge, you must read  integers from stdin and then print them to stdout.
// Each integer must be printed on a new line. To make the problem a little easier,
// a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor below.

import java.sql.SQLOutput;
import java.util.Scanner;

//Input Format:
//There are  lines of input, and each line contains a single integer.
public class stdin_and_stdout2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = scan.nextInt();
        int b = scan.nextInt();
        int c = scan.nextInt();;
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
